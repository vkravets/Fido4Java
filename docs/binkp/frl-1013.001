Status of this document
-----------------------

   This document is a Fidonet Reference Library document (FRL).

   This document arises from FSP-1011 which was rewritten and divided
   in several documents.

   The use of this extension is deprecated for the following reasons:

   * This extension is not compatible with the normal way Fidonet
     mailers do password authentication, that is use one common
     password for all presented addresses.
   * There are no known implementations of this extension.

   This document is released to the public domain, and may be used,
   copied or modified for any purpose whatever.


1. Definitions
--------------

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [FTA-1006].


2. Binkp Multiple Passwords Mode
--------------------------------

   Multiple password mode allows to specify different passwords for
   the different addresses of the remote.

   Originating side identifies it's multipassword capabilities by
   sending M_NUL "OPT MPWD" during session setup stage before sending
   any M_ADR commands and waits for response from the answering side.

   If answering side responds with the M_NUL "OPT MPWD", then it
   supports multiply passwords too. Answering side also always
   responds with it's own address list: M_ADR "adr1 adr2 adr3 ...". If
   M_NUL "OPT MPWD" was not received prior to the first M_ADR command,
   originating side should assume that the remote does not support
   multiple password mode and send a single password (if any) for one
   of the addresses of the remote.

   If the MPWD option was indicated by the answering side, originating
   side now may send M_PWD "pwd1 pwd2 pwd3 ..." with the number of
   entries in space separated password list equivalent to the number
   of addresses presented by the answering side. If there is no
   password for a particular address, it must send '-' character as a
   placeholder.

   If the passwords presented are consistent, answering side must
   acknowledge successful authentication by sending M_OK command.

   Note.
   -----
   This extension cannot be used together with the optional CRAM
   extension, that only allows one password for all aka's.
