   FTSC for the benefit of the Fidonet community.

   This document specifies an optional Fidonet standard protocol for
   the Fidonet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for

2. Binkp CRC Checksum Mode
--------------------------

2.1 Introduction
----------------

   Binkp originally was designed to work on top of a reliable
   transmission layer, i.E. a transmission layer that has its own
   checksums, like TCP. Therefore, the Binkp specification does not
   provide a way for controlling correct data transfer, because
   it is assumed that the underlying TCP transport layer does the
   necessary data integrity checks.

   However, I have seen TCP connections trashing data at random, and
   actually have suffered from mail loss because a file received by
   binkd was not identical with the file that the sender has
   transmitted.

   Therefore, this document specifies an extension to the Binkp
   protocol which allows data integrity checks by means of CRC32
   checksums. It is intended as an *optional* feature in Binkp for
   those nodes that live in places with an unreliable TCP routing
   structure (like I seem to do), and it is fully backwards
   compatible.


2.2 Protocol specification
--------------------------

   During session handshake, a mailer that knows the CRC protocol
   extension MAY send an "M_NUL OPT CRC" message. This indicates
   that the mailer is able to process the CRC-extended "M_FILE"
   messages described below, nothing more.

   The other end which receives the OPT CRC message will switch to
   CRC-secure mode (probably only if CRC-secure mode has been
   allowed by the sysop for the particluar other end). Note that
   even if this end previously has sent a M_NUL OPT CRC on its own,
   it is not forced to switch to CRC mode, it is just an option.

   In the following, the "sending end" is the Binkp mailer which is
   transmitting a file, and the "receiving end" is the mailer which
   is receiving it. Of course, in a Binkp session, both sides can
   become both sending and the receiving ends.

   When the sending end is in CRC-secure mode, it will send an
   extended M_FILE message with an additional fifth argument,
   specifying a CCITT CRC32 checksum for the file that is following.
   This means that the mailer has to calculate the checksum before
   transmitting the file.

   The checksum is pre-conditioned and postconditioned. This means
   that the initial CRC-value is 0xFFFFFFFF (preconditioning), and
   after the final value has been computed, all bits must be in-
   verted (postconditioning).

   The format of the fifth M_FILE argument is a sequence of up to
   eight hexadecimal digits in ASCII. Leading digits may be omitted,
   trailing digits must not be omitted.

   The receiving end, if it has sent an "M_NUL OPT CRC", MUST be
   able to process M_FILE messages with either four or five
   arguments. If it receives a M_FILE message with five arguments,
   it will treat the fifth argument as a checksum and, after
   receiving the file, will compare this checksum with the checksum
   it has computed from the data that has been received.

   If the checksums disagree, the receiving end has two options. It
   can either send a M_SKIP for this file. This will cause a
   non-destructive reject of the file, so that the session goes on,
   but the remote site will mark the file as not sent successfully
   and retransmit it in the next session. Or it can send a M_ERR,
   indicating a fatail failure, which will terminate the session,
   and also cause a non-destructive reject of this and all following
   files. It is suggested that on the first CRC failure, a M_SKIP
   is sent, but if the next file also has an error, indicating that
   the session is completely faulty, a M_ERR  could be transmitted
   instead.


2.3 Further thoughts
--------------------

   There are some disadvantages of this way of implementing CRC:

   1. The CRC checksum must be computed before the file
      transmission STARTS, instead of during the transmission.

   2. The protocol will fail if errors don't occur spontaneous, but
      regularly with an error rate  greater than 1 error per file. 
      In this case, transmission will be impossible because all 
      files will always be rejected.

   Why then implement it this way? It is the easiest way to
   implement CRC fully backwards compatible, and it is the way that
   requries the least amount of changes in the code of existing
   binkp mailers. Even given the mentioned disadvantages, the
   extension is good enough for detecting spontaneous transmission
   errors, so that sysops will not loose valuable data, and so that
   they can see that there is a problem in the network infrastructure
   and fix it. That is, this extension is intended as a safeguard 
   against rare error conditions on a transport layer that still, 
   basically, is reliable.

   This extension, however, is not suitable for transmission over a
   transport layer which is unreliable by definition, as a standard
   modem connection. But that was not the goal of binkp from the
   beginning.

   In the future, it might be worth considering an extension to the
   binkp protocol which goes furhter. For example, one CRC32
   checksum could be transmitted at the end of each frame, and a
   mechanism for directly resending frames


2.4 CRC-32 Algorithm
--------------------

   The checksum algorithm that is used is CRC-32 following ITU-T's
   specifications. For further information refer to the literature
   list given below. The following pseudocode shows how to
   calculate such a checksum for a file of N bytes indexed from 0 to
   N-1 and stored in BUFFER. The XOR, AND and NOT logical
   operations are to be executed bit-wise. In C, for instance, XOR
   equals ^, AND equals &, and NOT equals ~.

   // CRC, I, J, K are unsigned integers of at least 32 bits.
   UNSIGNED LONG CRC, I, J, K

   // Preconditioning
   CRC = FFFFFFFF

   // Loop through all bytes in the file
   FOR J = 0 TO N-1
      K = (CRC XOR BYTE#J) & 000000FF  // (*)
      FOR I = 8 DOWNTO 1
         IF K AND 1 <> 0
           THEN K = (K SHR 1) XOR EDB88320
         ELSE
           K = K SHR 1
         ENDIF
      END FOR                          // (**)
      CRC = ((CRC SHR 8) AND 00FFFFFF) XOR K
   END FOR

   // Postconditioning: Flip all bits
   CRC = NOT CRC;

   Note that as in the line marked as (*), K can initially only get
   values in the range from 0 to 255. Therefore it is a good idea
   to replace the inner loop over I with a lookup table routine,
   i.E. generate a lookup table for the outcomes of K after the loop
   with initial values of K from 0 to 255, and then replace lines
   (*) up to and including (**) with something like

    K = LOOKUPTABLE [ (CRC XOR BYTE#J) XOR 000000FF ]

3. Compatibility issues
-----------------------

   The CRC option cannot be used together with some other options
   which also use extra parameters with the M_FILE messages.
